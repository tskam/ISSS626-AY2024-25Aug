Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences. All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt, students should consult the instructors of the course. Details on the SMU Code of Academic Integrity may be accessed at http://www.smuscd.org/resources.html\n\n\n\nCourse materials obtained during your course of study at SMU are meant for personal use only, namely, for the purposes of studying and research.

You are also welcome to contact the university’s disability support team if you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations:included@smu.edu.sg\nPlease be aware that the accessible tables in our seminar room should remain available for students who require them. Emergency\n\n\n\nAs part of emergency preparedness, Instructors may conduct lessons online via the WebEx platform during the term, to prepare students for online learning. During an actual emergency, students will be notified to access the WebEx platform for their online lessons. The class schedule will mirror the current face-to-face class timetable unless otherwise stated."

    "text": "Where should the next new business outlet be located in order to optimise the profit? What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\nGeospatial Analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and processes using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\nconducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and Geomachine learning methods and\ncommunicating the geospatial analysis pipeline in a reproducible report."

    "text": "Grading Summary\n\n\n\nAssignments / Assessment categories\nWeighting\n\n\n\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation\n5%\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (2% x 10)\n20%\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (3% x 10)\n30%\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (15% x 3)\n45%\n\n\n\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation (5%)\nPre-lesson videos and recommended readings exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and video before coming to class. Students are required write down at least one question or issue encountered while viewing the video or reading the recommended articles and post them on Piazza for discussion.\nStudent sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course.\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (20%)\nHands-on exercises aim to provide students to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages to perform geospatial analysis with real world use cases. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (30%)\nIn-class exercise and discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling. The in-class discussion will also focus on how to interpret the analysis results and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate map and data visualisation techniques. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to in-class exercise.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (45%)\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real-world cases. Each take-home exercise is an extension of the hands-on and in-class exercises. What this means is that, for example, in Lesson 1, students will learn the concept of spatial point processes and the hands-on exercise will provide students step-by-step guide on how to use R packages to perform spatial point patterns analysis. The in-class discussion, beside clarification of the concepts and usage of R packages syntax and argument, it will focus more on how to interpret and communicate the analysis results. Then the take-home exercise will require students to synthesise what they have learned from the readings, hands-on exercise and in-class exercise. The estimated workload will be about 6-8 hours per week.\nEach take-home exercise will carry a same weightage of 15%. The deliverable format of the take-home exercises and marking rubric of will be provided on the handout of the take-home exercise. Feedback on take-home exercise will be provided weekly before the weekly lesson starts. This is to ensure that students will learn from mistakes made in the earlier take-home exercise and improve their work progressively in the subsequent take-home exercises.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere will be no final examination for this course."
