Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences. All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt, students should consult the instructors of the course. Details on the SMU Code of Academic Integrity may be accessed at http://www.smuscd.org/resources.html\n\n\n\nCourse materials obtained during your course of study at SMU are meant for personal use only, namely, for the purposes of studying and research.

If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers due to disability, please let the instructor know immediately. You are also welcome to contact the university’s disability support team if you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations:included@smu.edu.sg\nPlease be aware that the accessible tables in our seminar room should remain available for students who require them. Emergency\n\n\n\nAs part of emergency preparedness, Instructors may conduct lessons online via the WebEx platform during the term, to prepare students for online learning. During an actual emergency, students will be notified to access the WebEx platform for their online lessons. The class schedule will mirror the current face-to-face class timetable unless otherwise stated."

    "text": "Where should the next new business outlet be located in order to optimise the profit? What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\nGeospatial Analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and processes using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\nconducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and Geomachine learning methods and\ncommunicating the geospatial analysis pipeline in a reproducible report."

    "text": "Grading Summary\n\n\n\nAssignments / Assessment categories\nWeighting\n\n\n\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation\n5%\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (2% x 10)\n20%\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (3% x 10)\n30%\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (15% x 3)\n45%\n\n\n\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation (5%)\nPre-lesson videos and recommended readings exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and video before coming to class. Students are required write down at least one question or issue encountered while viewing the video or reading the recommended articles and post them on Piazza for discussion.\nStudent sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course.\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (20%)\nHands-on exercises aim to provide students to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages to perform geospatial analysis with real world use cases. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (30%)\nIn-class exercise and discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling. The in-class discussion will also focus on how to interpret the analysis results and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate map and data visualisation techniques. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to in-class exercise.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (45%)\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real-world cases. Each take-home exercise is an extension of the hands-on and in-class exercises. What this means is that, for example, in Lesson 1, students will learn the concept of spatial point processes and the hands-on exercise will provide students step-by-step guide on how to use R packages to perform spatial point patterns analysis. The in-class discussion, beside clarification of the concepts and usage of R packages syntax and argument, it will focus more on how to interpret and communicate the analysis results. Then the take-home exercise will require students to synthesise what they have learned from the readings, hands-on exercise and in-class exercise. The estimated workload will be about 6-8 hours per week.\nEach take-home exercise will carry a same weightage of 15%. The deliverable format of the take-home exercises and marking rubric of will be provided on the handout of the take-home exercise. Feedback on take-home exercise will be provided weekly before the weekly lesson starts. This is to ensure that students will learn from mistakes made in the earlier take-home exercise and improve their work progressively in the subsequent take-home exercises.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere will be no final examination for this course."

    "text": "Objectives\nBy and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely: behavioural and environmental factors. Behavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into two as, driver behavior (also called driver/driving style) and driver performance, in other words, driver/driving skills (Elander, West, & French, 1993). Environmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather condition such as poor visibility during heavy rain or foggy and road conditions such as sharp bend road, slippery slope road, and blind spot.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\nIn view of this, you are tasked to discover factors affecting road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region BMR by employing both spatial spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\nThe specific objectives of this take-home exercise are as follows:\n\nTo visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods."

    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readr, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAll data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis (25 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to utilize the geospatial analytics methods introduced in class, along with the R packages provided during the hands-on exercises, to perform your analysis. You will be assessed on your ability to apply these methods correctly and to provide accurate interpretations and discussions of the analysis results.\nGeovisualisation and Geocommunication (25 marks): In this section, your ability to effectively communicate complex geospatial analysis results through user-friendly visual representations will be assessed. Since this course is focused on geospatial analysis, it is crucial that you demonstrate proficiency in using appropriate geovisualization techniques to clearly convey the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (20 marks): This is a key learning outcome of this course. You will be assessed on your ability to thoroughly document the analysis procedures using code chunks within Quarto. It is important to note that simply providing the code chunks is insufficient; you must also include explanations of the purpose behind each step and the R function(s) used.\nBonus (10 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature."

For example, the proportional maps above use circle with different sizes to represent millions of people. There are two types of point features that are typically depicted with proportional symbols: features for which the data represents a geographic position directly (e.g., gallons of oil from individual oil wells), and features that are geographic areas to which data are aggregated and the data magnitudes are assigned to a representative point within the area (e.g., the geographic centroid of a state as in the examples above). In either case, the area of the symbol is scaled to represent the data magnitude, sometimes with a bit of exaggeration to adjust for a general tendency of human vision to underestimate differences in area. A variant on this direct data-to-symbol scaling groups values into categories first, then scales the symbol to represent the mean for the category, assigning a symbol to each place to represent the category range that the mean for the place falls within"

Such properties are usually measured with the so-called quadrat analysis, nearest neighbour index and kernel estimation. Second-order properties describe the covariance (or correlation) between values of the spatial point pattern at different regions in space and are usually measured with the G function, K function and L function. Applied to point event data, both properties could be used to explore the spatial variation in the risk of being victimized by a crime, spatial and space-time clustering of criminal activities, and the raised incidence of criminal activities around point sources, such as robberies around ATM machines, subway entrances and exits, etc."

These corrections are essential for ensuring accurate estimates in spatial point pattern analysis, especially for summary statistics like the K-function, L-function, pair correlation function, etc.\n\nCommon Edge Correction Methods in spatstat\n\n“none”: No edge correction is applied. This method assumes that there is no bias at the edges, which may lead to underestimation of statistics near the boundaries.\n“isotropic”: This method corrects for edge effects by assuming that the point pattern is isotropic (uniform in all directions). It compensates for missing neighbors outside the boundary by adjusting the distances accordingly.\n“translate” (Translation Correction): This method uses a translation correction, which involves translating the observation window so that every point lies entirely within it. The statistic is then averaged over all possible translations.\n“Ripley” (Ripley’s Correction): Similar to the isotropic correction but specifically tailored for Ripley’s K-function and related functions. It adjusts the expected number of neighbors for points near the edges based on the shape and size of the observation window.\n“border”: Border correction reduces bias by only considering points far enough from the boundary so that their neighborhood is fully contained within the window. This can be quite conservative but reduces the influence of edge effects."

With big datasets, it might be useful to use this simple method to do a primary investigation.\nIn a purely geographical view, this method is intuitive. In the case of crime analysis for example, one could argue that the strength of an event should not be affected by intersections on the network. In that case, the kernel function is seen as a distance decaying function."

This function is more time consuming, so it might be necessary to stop it when the recursion is too deep. Considering that the kernel density is divided at each intersection, stopping the function at deep level 16 should give results almost identical to the true values.\n\n\nNote that there are three different equations to calculate the kernel density depending on the situation (here, q1, q2, q3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs one can see, the values of the NKDE are continuous, and the density values close to the events have been adjusted.

    "text": "Network KDE (NKDE) Analysis\nIn this section, we will perform NKDE analysis by using appropriate functions provided in spNetwork package.\n\nPreparing the lixels objects\nBefore computing NKDE, the SpatialLines object need to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed by using with lixelize_lines() of spNetwork as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network, \n                         700, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\nWhat can we learned from the code chunk above:\n\nThe length of a lixel, lx_length is set to 700m, and\nThe minimum length of a lixel, mindist is set to 350m.\n\nAfter cut, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, then it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, then mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified\nNote: There is another function called lixelize_lines.mc() which provide multicore support.\n\n\nGenerating line centre points\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame (i.e. samples) with line centre points as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels) \n\nThe points are located at center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\nPerforming NKDE\nWe are ready to computer the NKDE by using the code chunk below.\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network, \n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300, \n                  div= \"bw\", \n                  method = \"simple\", \n                  digits = 1, \n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1), \n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5, \n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Are possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are: triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine ,triweight, epanechnikov or uniform.\nmethod argument indicates that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. Currently, spNetwork support three popular methods, they are:\n\nmethod=“simple”. This first method was presented by Xie et al. (2008) and proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an areal unit.\nmethod=“discontinuous”. The method is proposed by Okabe et al (2008), which equally “divides” the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\nmethod=“continuous”. If the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is a bit counter-intuitive. Okabe et al (2008) proposed another version of the kernel, that divide the mass of the density at intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\nThe user guide of spNetwork package provide a comprehensive discussion of nkde(). You should read them at least once to have a basic understanding of the various parameters that can be used to calibrate the NKDE model.\n\nVisualising NKDE\nBefore we can visualise the NKDE values, code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values (i.e. densities) into samples and lixels objects as density field.\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince svy21 projection system is in meter, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to resale the density values from number of events per meter to number of events per kilometer.\n\n# rescaling to help the mapping\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\nThe code below uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation.\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col=\"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nThe interactive map above effectively reveals road segments (darker color) with relatively higher density of childcare centres than road segments with relatively lower density of childcare centres (lighter color)"

    "text": "Network Constrained G- and K-Function Analysis\nIn this section, we are going to perform complete spatial randomness (CSR) test by using kfunctions() of spNetwork package. The null hypothesis is defined as:\nHo: The observed spatial point events (i.e distribution of childcare centres) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Punggol Planning Area.\nThe CSR test is based on the assumption of the binomial point process which implies the hypothesis that the childcare centres are randomly and independently distributed over the street network.\nIf this hypothesis is rejected, we may infer that the distribution of childcare centres are spatially interacting and dependent on each other; as a result, they may form nonrandom patterns.\n\nkfun_childcare &lt;- kfunctions(network, \n                             childcare,\n                             start = 0, \n                             end = 1000, \n                             step = 50, \n                             width = 50, \n                             nsim = 50, \n                             resolution = 50,\n                             verbose = FALSE, \n                             conf_int = 0.05)\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\nThere are ten arguments used in the code chunk above they are:\n\nlines: A SpatialLinesDataFrame with the sampling points. The geometries must be a SpatialLinesDataFrame (may crash if some geometries are invalid).\npoints: A SpatialPointsDataFrame representing the points on the network. These points will be snapped on the network.\nstart: A double, the start value for evaluating the k and g functions.\nend: A double, the last value for evaluating the k and g functions.\nstep: A double, the jump between two evaluations of the k and g function.\nwidth: The width of each donut for the g-function.\nnsim: An integer indicating the number of Monte Carlo simulations required. In the above example, 50 simulation was performed. Note: most of the time, more simulations are required for inference\nresolution: When simulating random points on the network, selecting a resolution will reduce greatly the calculation time. When resolution is null the random points can occur everywhere on the graph. If a value is specified, the edges are split according to this value and the random points are selected vertices on the new network.\nconf_int: A double indicating the width confidence interval (default = 0.05).\n\nFor the usage of other arguments, you should refer to the user guide of spNetwork package.\nThe output of kfunctions() is a list with the following values:\n\nplotkA, a ggplot2 object representing the values of the k-function\nplotgA, a ggplot2 object representing the values of the g-function\nvaluesA, a DataFrame with the values used to build the plots\n\nFor example, we can visualise the ggplot2 object of k-function by using the code chunk below.\n\nkfun_childcare$plotk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line is the empirical network K-function of the childcare centres in Punggol planning area. The gray envelop represents the results of the 50 simulations in the interval 2.5% - 97.5%. Because the blue line between the distance of 250m-400m are below the gray area, we can infer that the childcare centres in Punggol planning area resemble regular pattern at the distance of 250m-400m."
