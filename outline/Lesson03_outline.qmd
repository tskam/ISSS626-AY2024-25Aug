In this lesson, you will learn the basic concepts of Network Constrained KDE and Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimate. Using real-world use cases, you will also gain hands-on experience on using [spNetwork](https://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/index.html) to analyse spatial point patterns and temporal spatial along networks
